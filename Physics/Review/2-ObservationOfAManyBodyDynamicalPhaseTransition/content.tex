Large scale trapped ion system is an excellent platform for quantum simulation for quantum systems out of equilibrium. In this letter, Jiehang have utilized a trapped ion system with $53$ ions in the three layer trap to simulate the DPT, which is generated by a Ising Model with a sudden change in its Hamiltonian and the change can be induced by the switch of the AOM and it's called by quantum quench.

The Hamiltonian is implemented by a long-range Ising interactions, where the strength and the range of the interactions can both be tuned. At the beginning of the experimental sequence, the two-level system is initialized into a product state($x$ basis). Then a Hamiltonian could be turned on with the switch of AOM, and the Hamiltonian is generated by two global Raman beams, which is also denoted by spin-dependent optical dipole force and the force is aligned with wavelength difference $\Delta k$ along the principle axis of transverse motion.
